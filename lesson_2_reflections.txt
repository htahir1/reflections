Hey! This is for the second lesson.

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

We need to do it so that git starts tracking the files in our repo!

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

It lets me know what files to commit before actually commiting them. its a nice
way to look at all the changes in the file and gives me more control over what 
I commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

The staging area is the snapshop the latest diff along with the latest added changes from
the working directory. Using diff, I can see the changes I have made from the last commit
and so I can pinpoint a time where I need to commit again.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized?
How would branches help?

If I wanted to try out a new feature, make a language change, do other cool stuff without
breaking my code.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Diagrams help me see which commits are reachable from which branch.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in 
the diagram the way we do?

All the changes in both branches get combined together. We represent it in the 
diagram as a combination of all the commits made by both branches.
