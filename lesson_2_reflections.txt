Hey! This is for the second lesson.

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

We need to do it so that git starts tracking the files in our repo!

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

It lets me know what files to commit before actually commiting them. its a nice
way to look at all the changes in the file and gives me more control over what 
I commit.
