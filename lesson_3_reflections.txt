When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When there are other people working with me on the project, and when I want access to the files
across different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You don't want people seeing the changes you make while making those changes!

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would 
you use one instead of another?

I would fork when I want to extend an open source project on Github. I would branch when I
wanted to add a new feature on my own codebase, and I would clone when I wanted a codebase
from another area on my computer or on the cloud copied onto my computer locally.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You can check how far ahead you are of the latest remote copy even if you're offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and 
what would be harder?

I would make branches and make changes, and the make pull requests so that my mates
can check them and merge. It would be hard to see all the changes I make and merge, because
of conflicts. But it would be easier to collaborate.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in 
master? What benefits does each approach have?

YOu would want to make a seperate branch if you're working WITH people. This would help
them see the changes you've made before merging. If im working alone on a small project,
one branch would be enough and I could make changes directly in master.
