When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When there are other people working with me on the project, and when I want access to the files
across different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You don't want people seeing the changes you make while making those changes!

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would 
you use one instead of another?

I would fork when I want to extend an open source project on Github. I would branch when I
wanted to add a new feature on my own codebase, and I would clone when I wanted a codebase
from another area on my computer or on the cloud copied onto my computer locally.
