When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When there are other people working with me on the project, and when I want access to the files
across different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You don't want people seeing the changes you make while making those changes!
